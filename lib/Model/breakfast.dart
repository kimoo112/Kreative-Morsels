  HomeBuildBR(image: "assets/Breakfast1.jpg", Text: "Eggs and Toast", recpie: """Ingredients:

Pizza dough
Pizza sauce
Cheese (mozzarella, or a blend of cheeses)
Toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, olives, etc.)
Olive oil
Salt
Italian seasoning (optional)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the pizza dough package instructions.

Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. You can shape it into a round, rectangular, or any desired shape.

Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza stone, baking sheet, or pizza pan. If using a baking sheet, you may want to lightly grease it with olive oil or sprinkle it with cornmeal to prevent sticking.

Brush the surface of the dough with olive oil. This will help create a crispy crust.

Spread a layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

Sprinkle a generous amount of cheese over the sauce. You can use mozzarella cheese or a combination of cheeses like cheddar and mozzarella.

Add your favorite toppings. Whether it's pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, olives, or any other toppings, distribute them evenly over the cheese.

Sprinkle a pinch of salt and Italian seasoning (optional) over the pizza toppings for added flavor.

Carefully transfer the pizza into the preheated oven and bake according to the pizza dough package instructions or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.

Slice the pizza into desired portions and serve hot.

Enjoy your homemade pizza!"""),

  HomeBuildBR(image: "assets/Breakfast3.jpg", Text: "Pancakes", recpie: """Ingredients:

2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cans (14 oz each) diced tomatoes
1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce
1 cup vegetable or chicken broth
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup heavy cream (optional, for a creamy version)
Fresh basil leaves (for garnish, optional)
Instructions:

In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.

Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant.

Add the diced tomatoes (with their juices), tomato sauce, vegetable or chicken broth, sugar, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the pot. Stir well to combine.

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

After simmering, use an immersion blender or transfer the mixture to a blender in batches to puree the soup until smooth. Be cautious when blending hot liquids and ensure the blender is vented to avoid pressure build-up.

Return the blended soup to the pot if necessary. If desired, stir in the heavy cream to make a creamy tomato soup. Heat the soup over low heat until warmed through.

Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or pepper if needed.

Serve the tomato soup hot. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired."""),
