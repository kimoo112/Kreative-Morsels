  HomeBuild(image: "assets/pizza.jpg", Text: "Pizza", recpie: """Ingredients:

Pizza dough
Pizza sauce
Cheese (mozzarella, or a blend of cheeses)
Toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, olives, etc.)
Olive oil
Salt
Italian seasoning (optional)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the pizza dough package instructions.

Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. You can shape it into a round, rectangular, or any desired shape.

Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza stone, baking sheet, or pizza pan. If using a baking sheet, you may want to lightly grease it with olive oil or sprinkle it with cornmeal to prevent sticking.

Brush the surface of the dough with olive oil. This will help create a crispy crust.

Spread a layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

Sprinkle a generous amount of cheese over the sauce. You can use mozzarella cheese or a combination of cheeses like cheddar and mozzarella.

Add your favorite toppings. Whether it's pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, olives, or any other toppings, distribute them evenly over the cheese.

Sprinkle a pinch of salt and Italian seasoning (optional) over the pizza toppings for added flavor.

Carefully transfer the pizza into the preheated oven and bake according to the pizza dough package instructions or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.

Slice the pizza into desired portions and serve hot.

Enjoy your homemade pizza!"""),
